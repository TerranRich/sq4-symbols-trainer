# Space Quest IV Symbols Trainer
Trainer to memorize Xenon symbols in Space Quest IV

I created a 13x15 sprite (upscaled to 3x size) for each of the 15 Xenonian characters on the timepod control keypad. Then, I wrote some simple Javascript to display a random sequence of six characters. The purpose is to train oneself to memorize a sequence, just long enough to write it down during the timepod launch sequence.

## Naming convention
So,  yeah, I had to arbitrarily assign a Latin letter to each Xenonian symbol. I went with what I had always seen in my youth playing this game, when I first "saw" letters that I recognized among the 15-character set.

In the order depicted on the timepod's keypad:

Xenonian | Latin
--- | ---
![letter S with bottom slice](images/s.png) | **S**
![letter U with bottom slice](images/u.png) | **U**
![letter N, corners replaced with dots](images/n.png) | **N**
![letter H with partial top slice](images/h.png) | **H**
![letter Y, but more like a 4](images/y.png) | **Y**
![letter E with top and bottom slices](images/e.png) | **E**
![letter T with top slice](images/t.png) | **T**
![letter D with partial top and bottom slices](images/d.png) | **D**
![letter L with top and bottom slices, plus an uneven chunk](images/l.png) | **L** (I disregard the uneven chunk)
![letter C with vertical slice](images/c.png) | **C**
![letter A with top slice](images/a.png) | **A**
![letter R (or F) with corner slice](images/r.png) | **R** (or **F**)
![letter J with top cap, and vertical slice; or uppercase cursive G (kinda)](images/j.png) | **J** (or **ùí¢** &ndash; uppercase cursive G)
![letter I with top and bottom slice](images/i.png) | **I**
![letter P (or a question mark)](images/p.png) | **P**

I know there's a font out there that assigns my **D** to **"B"**, and **J**/**G** to **"D"**, but my childhood memories override that here, sorry. That said, I'll be honest, the **L** and **J**/**G** are the hardest to memorize for the 1 or 2 seconds I need before I enter in the first code into the timepod on Xenon, giving me time to write it down for later use at the Arcade in the Galaxy Galleria Mall.
