# Space Quest IV Symbols Trainer
Trainer to memorize Xenon symbols in Space Quest IV

I created a 13x15 sprite (upscaled to 3x size) for each of the 15 Xenonian characters on the timepod control keypad. Then, I wrote some simple Javascript to display a random sequence of six characters. The purpose is to train oneself to memorize a sequence, just long enough to write it down during the timepod launch sequence.
